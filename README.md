# FourierNN
Neural Net exploration of image data from the Epoch of Reionization in Fourier and non-Fourier space. 

TODO:
short-term:
-in real space replace global avgpool with global maxpool
-allow model to load partial datasets
-documentation

long-term:
-create complex dataset with the conjugate modes discarded
-create complex model
-run complex model with real dataset
-run complex model with fourier space dataset
